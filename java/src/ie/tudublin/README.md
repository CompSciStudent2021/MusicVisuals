# Description of the assignment
Our groups Music Visualizer compiles a montage of different visuals all inspired by the song "Borderline" by Tame Impala.

# Instructions
Press Ctrl + f5 to debug and start running the code, once the pApplet has opened, press 1 to start the song. After this, cycle through 1, 2 and 3 to see the three scenes made for it.

# How it works
- We started working on this by coming up with our own ideas on a particular theme which was *space*.
- We each made one file which was one scene and it was all run through a Player file which was then called by the Main to run through the PApplet.
- The main file calls the Player file which calls the music file and acts as a main menu where the viewer can select the various scenes through number inputs.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
## Sam
- I'm most proud of grinding my way through this assignment and learning new things throughout. All this should help me in the exam later on and also for further down the line during internship etc. 

## Deyor
- What I'm most proud of is being able to express myself creatively through coding. I am also proud of how well our team worked together and how we overcame obstacles.

## Ryan
- I am most proud of the learning done with Java over the course of this assignment. It is a language I particularly struggle with however this was an execellent learning experience for me.
